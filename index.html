        <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
        <br>
        <p>
          I'm Anshul, an 18-year-old sophomore at Dartmouth College from Scarsdale, NY.
          <br><br>
          I taught myself basic Java when I was 11 years old and since then have programmed
          Android apps, Chrome extensions, and websites, taking college CS courses before graduating high school.
          My favorite language is Java, but I also have experience in C++, HTML/CSS, Javascript, Python, and SQL, among others.
          My favorite project was a Chrome extension that I coded for my high school senior thesis trying to detect fake news.
          <br><br>
          My favorite thing about programming is watching a project come together in real time as I'm coding it.
          <br><br>
          Aside from coding, I'm an executive and choreographer for Street Soul, an urban dance troupe at Dartmouth, as well
          as an activist who's organized events and made calls for the ACLU.
